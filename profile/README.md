# We are Dangerous

## About Us
We are Developers, we are Dangerous â€“ a forward-thinking team dedicated to expanding the frontiers of cybernetic implants, cryptography, and communication. 
Our mission is to pioneer a new era of the decentralised internet, characterized by its privacy, security, and freedom from restrictions.

## Our Vision
We envision a world where the internet empowers individuals, unshackled by constraints or prying eyes, where users are safeguarded by advanced cryptographic techniques. 
> "Not your keys, not your crypto"

Our focus lies in creating groundbreaking software that enhances cybernetic implant / in-vivo capability, making digital interactions more private and secure than ever before.

### Note: 

1. We are not affiliated with or directly backed by [Dangerous Things](https://dangerousthings.com/)
    - That being said, this group would not have been possible without the immense support and camaraderie in that community.
  
2. We recieve direct support from external providers including:
    - [Tritium Cyber Defence](https://www.tritiumcyberdefence.com/) (Australian Group not acting as a business or for profit)
    - Support as dev time, hardware, server hosting and security testing.
3. All repositories are now and forever open source and free to use. However:
   - Our free to use model may include standard payments such as *gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain*.
   - Dangerous community will never take, request, or force payment for software external from those which are hard coded and unavoidable such as gas fees.
  
### What we believe: 
1. [Privacy and Encryption is a Human Right.](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/cypherpunk-manifesto.txt)
2. The internet offers us the ability to communicate like never before.
3. We will always **empower** the right and ability to **free speech**.
